                        <p align="center"><h4><u>Review</u>: No one likes getting old, but it is inevitable. The concept of death is a bit grim of course, but not when you bring in relativity.
                            Imagine this — there’s a sign, far off in the future, with a number on it. And that number represents the age your death. Every year that you live, you advance closer to the sign — because the sign is stationary. So when you reach the sign, theoretically you die. But that’s boring.<p><u> rating </u> - &#9733&#9733&#9733;</p></h3></p></p><br><hr><br>

                                <p align="center"><h4><u>Review</u>: Seven Husbands Of Evelyn Hugo by Taylor Jenkins Reid More than that, though, this novel is so heavily tied to the concepts of identity and self appreciation that, though it is considered to be a romance and a historical fiction novel, I would classify it as a tale of self love and acceptance. Certainly, it's an excellent read for anyone who needs to feel something.<p><u> rating </u> - &#9733&#9733&#9733;</p></h4></p></p><br><hr><br>
